# Capital-Skill-Complementarity
This repository is for an econometric project I worked on in Spring 2019. 

I tested the effects of broadband internet on skilled employment. Utilizing differences in differences regression techniques, I utilized a natural experiment design to measure changes in employment in areas with and without broadband internet. 

This code was run in STATA. Because the .dta file is several gigs, I was unable to include it in the repository. I have, however, provided my tables, research, and presentations that accompanied this experiment. If you would like the data, please feel free to reach out and I will send it to you.
